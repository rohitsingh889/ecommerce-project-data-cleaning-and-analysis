# E-commerce Sales Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning, transforming, and analyzing a multi-table e-commerce dataset from **Olist**, a Brazilian marketplace. The goal is to uncover insights about **customer behavior, product performance, and delivery efficiency** through Python-based data wrangling, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). The cleaned dataset is also ready for dashboard visualization in **Power BI**.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, duplicates, inconsistencies, and outliers.  
- **Data Transformation**: Created new features, calculated delivery and approval times, and aggregated sales data by product and region.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized trends and patterns using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**.  
- **Data Storage**: Cleaned data loaded into **PostgreSQL** for further analysis and reporting.

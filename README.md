![Logo](https://github.com/rohitsingh889/ecommerce-project-data-cleaning-and-analysis/blob/main/logo.webp)
## Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning, transforming, and analyzing a multi-table e-commerce dataset from **Olist**, a Brazilian marketplace. The goal is to uncover insights about **customer behavior, product performance, and delivery efficiency** through Python-based data wrangling, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). The cleaned dataset is also ready for dashboard visualization in **Power BI**.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, duplicates, inconsistencies, and outliers to ensure data quality.  
- **Data Transformation**: Created new features such as delivery time, approval time, and aggregated sales data by product and region.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized sales trends, customer behavior, product performance, and delivery efficiency using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**.  
- **Data Storage**: Prepared datasets for PostgreSQL, enabling queries, aggregations, and integration with BI tools.  
- **Dashboard Ready**: Cleaned and structured dataset ready for interactive dashboards in Power BI.  

## Dataset Details
- **Source**: [Kaggle - Olist Brazilian E-commerce Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce)  
- **Format**: CSV  
- **License**: Public  
- **Description**: This dataset contains multiple tables representing customers, orders, payments, products, sellers, reviews, and geolocation data for a Brazilian e-commerce platform. It is ideal for analyzing sales trends, customer behavior, and logistics performance.

## üóÇÔ∏è Database Schema

## Summary of Operations

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Removed duplicate records across all tables.  
- Imputed or dropped missing values based on analysis requirements.  
- Standardized categorical columns (e.g., state codes, product categories).  
- Corrected inconsistent date formats and removed outliers in numerical columns.

### 2. Data Transformation
- Calculated **delivery time**: difference between order purchase and delivery dates.  
- Calculated **order approval time**: difference between order creation and approval.  
- Created aggregated metrics:
  - Total sales per product  
  - Revenue per seller  
  - Customer order frequency  
- Merged multiple tables into a **master dataset** for analysis.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Sales Analysis**: Top-selling products, total revenue by category, seasonal trends.  
- **Customer Analysis**: Geographic distribution, repeat purchases, review sentiment trends.  
- **Delivery Analysis**: Average delivery times, late deliveries by state, correlation with product type.  
- **Visualizations**: Bar plots, heatmaps, boxplots, and line charts using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

### 4. Data Storage & Dashboard Preparation
- Loaded cleaned and transformed data into **PostgreSQL** for further querying.  
- Prepared datasets for **Power BI dashboards**:
  - Product performance dashboard  
  - Customer behavior dashboard  
  - Delivery efficiency dashboard

## Tools & Libraries

- **Python**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- **SQL**: PostgreSQL
- **BI**: Power BI
- **Other**: Kaggle API, gdown

## Insights

- Analyze trends in e-commerce sales across products, regions, and customer segments to understand distribution and performance.
- Identify the most frequent products, top-selling categories, and customer purchasing behavior to highlight business patterns.
- Examine delivery times, late orders, and payment methods to assess operational efficiency.
- Provide actionable insights for data-driven decision-making in product strategy, marketing, and logistics.

**Rohit Raj Singh**  
This project is part of my portfolio, showcasing **data engineering skills** applied to the [Olist Brazilian E-commerce Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

It demonstrates practical experience in:

* **Data ingestion** of multiple raw CSV datasets (orders, customers, products, payments, reviews).  
* **Data cleaning & transformation** (handling missing values, duplicates, outliers, feature creation).  
* **Building a structured data pipeline** from raw files to a cleaned, analysis-ready format.  
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to validate data quality and extract trends.  
* **Loading into PostgreSQL** as a data warehouse schema (fact and dimension tables).  
* **SQL querying & aggregations** to support analytics and business insights.  

This work reflects the type of **end-to-end data engineering expertise** needed to design, clean, transform, and deliver data pipelines that power analytics and business intelligence solutions.
